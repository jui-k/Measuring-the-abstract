# Measuring-the-abstract
Many studies strive to measure happiness and growth, but how? They are immeasurable, subjective, and abstract. And when looking for a place to move, it can be a good idea to be able to know something that has so far been considered abstract. Happiness could be perceived by the state of a personâ€™s well-being, life satisfaction, etc. The most common approach, utilized by nearly all the reports we have read, summarizes surveys of self-reported measures of happiness. Who knows your state of happiness better than yourself?   We collected the data from people living across Pune city, by asking various questions and calculated what the average score comes out to be, and compared it to the average score in various categories in the city.  We do understand that surveys asking people about life satisfaction and happiness do measure subjective well-being with reasonable accuracy.  We used the data from PMC to make sure we also provide measurable data about the surroundings of the chosen location, like schools, hospitals, prices of homes, etc. So, people can make more of an informed decision when planning to shift to another location.
